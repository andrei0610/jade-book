#A Closing Note
##Contributing Back to Jade
Jade is made possible by a wonderful group of volunteers who are passionate about making web development easier. The language was created by TJ Holowaychuk (who also made express, mocha, and over 300 other open source projects) in 2010. Since then, more than [100 volunteers](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/graphs/contributors) have joined him in improving Jade. The project is now maintained by primarily by Forbes Lindesay.

All of these contributors deserve a huge thank-you for making Jade happen. Without them, Jade wouldn't be the superpower that it is today.

Because Jade is purely community-built, I ask that you consider helping to improve Jade. This can be through offering support to other Jade users, submitting pull requests to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade), writing about why Jade is awesome, discussing ways to make Jade better on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/issues), improving the documentation, or even by donating to someone else who has helped. These contributions help make Jade better for everyone and are a great way to improve your own programming skill while giving back to the community.
